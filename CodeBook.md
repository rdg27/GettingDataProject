**variable**

text

The measurement being summarised. One of 66 values.  Mean and standard deviation
for each of the following where '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the 
X, Y and Z directions:

* Body and gravity acceleration signals:
  * tBodyAcc-XYZ
  * tGravityAcc-XYZ
  * tBodyGyro-XYZ
* Body linear acceleration and angular velocity derived in time to obtain Jerk signals: 
  * tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
  * tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
* The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals calculated using the Euclidean norm:
  * tBodyAccMag
  * tGravityAccMag
  * tBodyAccJerkMag
  * tBodyGyroMag
  * tBodyGyroJerkMag
* A Fast Fourier Transform was applied to produce:
  * fBodyAcc-XYZ
  * fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
  * fBodyGyro-XYZ
  * fBodyAccMag
  * fBodyAccJerkMag
  * fBodyGyroMag
  * fBodyGyroJerkMag
